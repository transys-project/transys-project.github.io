# Transport Optimization for Streaming Systems

## Abstract

While deep learning (DL)-based networked systems have shown great potential in various applications, a key drawback is that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in DL are blackboxes and nontransparent for network operators. The lack of interpretability makes DL-based networked systems challenging to operate and troubleshoot, which further prevents DL-based networked systems from deploying in practice. In this paper, we propose TranSys, a novel framework to explain DL-based networked systems for practical deployment. Transys categorizes current DL-based networked systems and introduces different explanation methods based on decision tree and hypergraph to effectively explain DL-based networked systems. TranSys can explain the DNN policies in the form of decision trees and highlight critical components based on analysis over hypergraph. We evaluate TranSys over several typical DL-based networked systems and demonstrate that Transys can provide human-readable explanations for network operators. We also present three use cases of Transys, which could (i) help network operators troubleshoot DL-based networked systems, (ii) improve the decision latency and resource consumption of DL-based networked systems by ~10x on different metrics, and (iii) provide suggestions on daily operations for network operators when incidences occur.
